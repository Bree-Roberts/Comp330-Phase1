## Getting Started and Overall Work

When thinking about how to structure our code, we wanted to build a simple code that would be able to prompt a question on the screen, allow the user to select an answer, and then show the right answer. Even though it sounded easy at first, there was some trouble we ran into. The code was supposed to hold the questions in a string and show the user a question to choose from. The first two questions were multiple-choice, followed by a “True or False” and then fill in the blank. We had made ten questions before designing the code to make up the quiz, but we only used four and styled them differently. Like the questions, the answer choices were coded in a string. After getting the question, the program was supposed to get the answer choices. We wanted to have the questions be read from a JSON or XML format, but neither of us had experience working with them. In the end, the program should show the correct answer to the user after getting it from the getCorrect Answer string. However, when designing our code, we kept getting errors that we tried to fix. Instead of asking for help, we thought we could learn how to fix the problem on our own, but we weren't able to get it to work. 

### Prerequisites

For this project, we worked on Android Studio v3.4.1. Since the IDE was a reqruiment for COMP 313, both of us felt comfortable using the program to write the code. No installation was needed since the program we had already downloawed it. However, to download Android Studio to your computer, all you have to do is download it from https://developer.android.com/studio. There is a User Guide section that helps answer questions about how to install and use Android Studio on yourcomputer. 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Inside Android Studio 3.4.1, run the Quiz.java file in the terminal. Enter the command line javac Quiz.java, to run the code. The questions should appear one by one allowing the user to choose an answer. However, we were not able to get the code running.
