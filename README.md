# Comp330-Phase1

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For this project, we worked on Android Studio v3.4.1. Since the IDE was a reqruiment for COMP 313, both of us felt comfortable using the program to write the code. No installation was needed since the program we had already downloawed it. However, to download Android Studio to your computer, all you have to do is download it from https://developer.android.com/studio. There is a User Guide section that helps answer questions about how to install and use Android Studio on yourcomputer. 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Inside Android Studio 3.4.1, run the Quiz.java file in the terminal. Enter the command line javac Quiz.java, to run the code. The questions should appear one by one allowing the user to choose an answer. However, we were not able to get the code running.
